Here I will collect the list of known errors in the book "Linear Algebra via Exterior Products." Please email me if you find other errors. I am grateful to all readers who notified me of errors in this book.

In Sec. 1.1.2, the definition of a "number field" in terms of axioms should explicitly mention the associativity of the operations + and *. (Reported by Jiri Matousek <matousek@...>.)

In Sec. 1.1.2 (page 13), there is an incorrect property "a*1=1" listed (instead of "a*1=a"). (Reported by Joseph Ferrara <joe@te...>.)

In Sec. 1.1.2 (page 15), in Definition V2, item 3, the associativity property should be added: λ*(μ*v)=(λ*μ)*v. (Reported by Dmitri Pavlov <pavlov239@...>.)

In Sec. 1.4, the definition of "canonically defined linear map" is not really a description of a property of a linear map. One cannot say precisely what it means that a map is "defined independently of a choice of basis". Rather, it is a property of the way we construct the map; it is useful to know that certain maps are constructed independently of a basis. (Prof. Matousek recommends that this "definition" be considered as heuristic at this point.)

In Sec. 1.5.1, first paragraph, in the phrase "It is easy to check that this is a linear and one-to-one map of the subspace {(v,0) | v ∈ V } to V , and that Pˆ is a projector" the symbol Pˆ must be replaced by PˆV. Also, P is not a projector because it maps between different spaces. The phrase "that P is a projector" should be deleted. (Reported by Christophe Louargant <christo...>.)

At the beginning of Sec. 1.6.1, unnumbered formula at top of page 39 has a mistake where u_i  must be replaced by u_j in the last term. (Reported by Christophe Louargant <christo...>.)

At the beginning of Sec. 1.6.1 there is a Remark to the effect that "the dual space V* may be larger or smaller than V" if V is infinite-dimensional. This remark is imprecise and should be revised: there are too many subtleties of functional analysis to talk about "larger" or "smaller" dual infinite-dimensional spaces at this point. It is safe to say that the dual space may be "larger" in the sense that a linear map V -> V* exists such that it is an injection but not a surjection. (Reported by Jiri Matousek.)

In Sec. 1.7.3, in the proof of Lemma 3, after Eq. (1.23) the text "Then we apply the map f*... defined in Lemma 1" must be replaced by "... defined in Lemma 2." (Reported by Pablo Dominguez <pablodgz@...>.)

In Sec. 1.7.3, the statement of the same Lemma 3 has an error: it refers to the sets {v1, ..., vm} and {u1, ..., un} , whereas it should refer to {v1, ..., vm}  and {w1, ..., wn}.  The proof is unaffected. (Reported by Andrew J. Ho <ho.andrew.j@...> and corrected by Yuxi Liu <yliu...@...>.)

In Sec. 2.3.4, the calculations in Example 1 and Example 2 contain errors in arithmetic. (Reported by Gabriel Aguirre <gabriel.agirre@...>.) Corrected calculations are as follows: In Example 1, the vector c1=c-2b is equal to -e2+29e3, rather than to -e2+9e3 as printed. Hence, the vector a1+6c1 equals 280e3 rather than 160e3 as printed. The final result has the coefficient -280 instead of -160. In Example 2, the vector c1 is replaced by c1+3b1, but this is incorrect because this does not eliminate the vector e2. The correct elimination procedure must replace b1 by b1+3c1. The correct final answer for Example 2 is 2 e1 e2 e3 - 7 e1 e2 e4 + 3 e1 e3 e4 + e2 e3 e4.

In Sec. 4.3 I discuss the generalization of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and make a statement to the effect that an identically vanishing polynomial in some operator can be found (this is the last statement in Theorem 2). This statement should be regarded as a conjecture rather than a known fact. I do prove that there is a particular system of algebraic equations satisfied by several operators. However, I did not prove that this system of equations is reducible to a polynomial equation in a single operator, i.e. that one can eliminate all other variables from the system. This part of statement (actually, the entire Theorem 2) is not used anywhere in the text; in any case, I don't know how to prove this. Other parts of Theorem 2 are correct. (Noticed by myself.)

In Sec. 4.5.3, the first equation should read "exp G(x) = ..." instead of "G(x) = ...". (Noticed by myself.)
